Initial plan
    - Start by setting up a git repository 
    - Use springInitializr to start up a gradle project

    - Use thymeleaf and html to begin front-end design of the project
    - Use methods to connect h2 database to front-end

Statement of purpose for the MS
    BUSINESS PROBLEM:
    With the film industry producing thousands of new movies on average each year, the vast and ever expanding catalogue of movie options makes it extremely difficult for people to quickly deside what to watch.
    WHAT THE MS WILL DO:
    The purpose of my Microservice is simply to aid users in finding appropriate movies to watch based on their mood. 
    THE TARGET AUDIENCE:
    The MS will be able to reach a large demographic, as it targets anyone interested in watching movies reguardless of gender, age, race, income etc.

List of features
    -Textboxes:
        The user will open the site and use the textboxes provided to input their desired number of movies as well as the mood they would like to base their search on.

    -Submit button:
        The front page will have a submit button, which will take the user to the ‘results’ page, and display a list with the requested movies. 

    -Reset button
        The reset button will reset the users input incase of a mistake.

    -‘Select more movies’ link
        The results page will also include a ‘Select more movies’ link, which, once clicked, will take the user back to a fresh front page, where the user can select a different number of movies or mood.
